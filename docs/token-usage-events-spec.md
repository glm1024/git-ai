# TokenUsage Events

Token usage and estimated cost per `(session_id, model, bucket_ts)` in
5-minute UTC buckets, computed from local agent transcripts and emitted as
metric event id 11 (`TokenUsageValues`, `src/metrics/events.rs`).

The parsing/deduplication logic is ported from
[ccusage](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage) (MIT) and adapted to git-ai's
incremental transcript streaming; per-agent deviations are documented in
`src/token_usage/{claude,codex}.rs`. v1 covers Claude Code and Codex.

## Pipeline

```
transcript file --(incremental read, cursor in token-usage DB)-->
  per-agent extractor (src/token_usage/{claude,codex}.rs)
    - prefilter substring check before any JSON parsing
    - per-entry token counts, model, timestamp, transcript costUSD
--> usage_entries (globally deduplicated per-entry rows, token-usage DB)
--> reconcile all session buckets in one pass: aggregate + fingerprint
    compare (bucket_state)
--> TokenUsage MetricEvent --> telemetry queue --> POST /worker/metrics/upload
```

Driven by `TokenUsageWorker` (`src/daemon/token_usage_worker.rs`):

- **Triggers:** a non-blocking ping from the stream worker after it
  successfully processes a transcript (a failed stream pass is picked up by
  the next sweep instead), a startup sweep, and a
  30-minute ticker (missed ticks are skipped, not replayed). Sweeps enumerate
  the streams database's `transcript` rows, so every session git-ai knows
  about is backfilled (a new file starts at byte offset 0); enumeration costs
  one stat per session compared against the token database's size/mtime
  snapshot, and per-file work only happens for files that actually changed.
  Transcripts that no longer exist are skipped. Nothing runs on the trace2
  ingestion path.
- **Queues:** notifications and sweep backfill are separate queues. The
  `git-ai await` drain barrier waits only for notification-driven work, so a
  first-start historical backfill cannot starve `await`; a notification for a
  file already queued for backfill promotes it. Shutdown is observed while a
  pass is in flight (the worker selects on its own shutdown `Notify` around
  the blocking pass).
- **Feature flag:** `token_usage_metrics` (debug: on, release: off) gates the
  worker at daemon startup, like `transcript_streaming`. When the flag is
  off, no worker or ticker runs, the token-usage database is not created, and
  a previously created one is deleted at daemon startup (independent of the
  `transcript_streaming` gate) — no collected data is retained.
- **Quietness:** unchanged files are skipped by size/mtime; unchanged buckets
  are never re-emitted (fingerprints); files whose last pass failed back off
  (5s/30s/5m/30m) instead of retrying on every trigger; the telemetry-buffer
  backpressure mirrors the stream worker.

## State: `~/.git-ai/internal/token-usage-db`

`TokenUsageDatabase` (`src/token_usage/db.rs`):

- `tracked_files` - read cursor (byte offset) + serialized extractor state
  per transcript file, plus the quiet-skip snapshot, error backoff state, and
  a pending-flush marker (a file whose extractor holds buffered entries is
  re-processed even when its bytes have not changed).
- `usage_entries` - deduplicated per-entry usage. Per-entry rows (rather than
  bucket accumulators) make ccusage's replacement policy exact: a later entry
  can *lower* a bucket (streaming partial replaced; sidechain replay replaced
  by the parent's entry), and the bucket then re-aggregates via SQL.
  **Dedup is global across sessions**, matching ccusage's whole-files dedup:
  `claude --resume`/`--continue`/fork copies the parent conversation into a
  new session file with the original message/request ids, and session-scoped
  dedup would re-count that history on every resume. When a replacement moves
  an entry between sessions, the previous owner is durably flagged
  (`needs_reconcile`, in the same transaction) and re-reconciled DB-only —
  inline after the pass and from sweeps for crash recovery — so the
  correction lands even if that session's transcripts were deleted. Entries
  older than the 90-day retention window are dropped at insert (backfill
  never uploads history the prune would delete), and stored entries/bucket
  state are pruned atomically on sweep.
- `bucket_state` - fingerprint, emission revision (`emit_seq`), and timestamp
  of the last emitted aggregate per bucket.

`commit_batch` writes entries, extractor state, and the advanced cursor in a
single transaction. This is why the cursor lives here and not in the streams
database: a crash can never replay transcript lines against post-batch parser
state (which would corrupt Codex's cumulative-delta computation).

## Emission semantics

The server upserts on `(session_id, model, bucket_ts)` keeping the **highest
`emitted_seq`** — a strictly increasing per-bucket revision, reserved in the
state database *before* events reach the telemetry queue so a crash between
sink and bookkeeping can never produce two payloads with equal revisions —
so re-emissions within the same u32 second cannot tie on `event_ts`,
regardless of upload batching or retry order. Reserved revisions are floored
to wall-clock seconds (`max(prev + 1, now)`), so a rebuilt state database
(the flag toggled off deletes it; local data loss) resumes at revisions
strictly above anything previously uploaded rather than restarting at 1 and
losing every upsert to the server's highest-revision rule. A bucket is emitted iff its aggregate's fingerprint
differs from the last emitted fingerprint; an emptied bucket therefore emits
an all-zero event exactly once. Changed buckets are found by reconciling
fingerprints across all of the session's buckets in one grouped query on
every pass (no pending-emission state lives in memory), buckets are marked
emitted only after the telemetry queue accepted the events, and the
quiet-skip size/mtime snapshot is written only after a fully successful pass
— so a failed hand-off or a crash at any point is healed by the next pass.
At upload time TokenUsage events get the same repo allow/exclude gate as
SessionEvents (they are transcript-derived, so they keep flowing for sessions
tracked before a repo was excluded); repo_url resolution falls back to the
agent's cwd inference (persisted back) like the SessionEvent path.

Values (`token_usage_pos`): `bucket_ts`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `total_tokens`,
`reasoning_output_tokens` (optional; Codex reports it as a subset of output),
`est_cost_micro_usd` (u64 micro-USD), `credits` (f64, reserved),
`message_count`, and `emitted_seq`. Standard `EventAttributes` carry tool,
model, session ids, and repo_url (no git spawn).

Cost follows ccusage's "auto" mode per entry: the transcript's own `costUSD`
wins (negative/non-finite values are treated as absent, and every per-entry
cost clamps to a $10k sanity ceiling); otherwise cost is computed from the
models.dev pricing catalog (`src/metrics/model_pricing.rs`), including the
2x-input rate for 1-hour ephemeral cache writes and a cache-read fallback of
a tenth of the input rate when the catalog omits one. Pricing snapshot
refreshes do not retroactively rewrite already-emitted buckets (only changed
buckets recompute) - intended. Documented pricing deviations from ccusage
(all from pricing via models.dev only): no long-context tiers, no fast-speed
multipliers, no `codex-auto-review` model mapping; `git-ai usage`
approximates from the same catalog without the 1h/fallback refinements, so
TokenUsage events are the authoritative dollars.

## Session identity

Claude subagent transcripts roll up to their parent session (matching
ccusage's session semantics), which also lets sidechain replays of parent
messages deduplicate against the parent's entries across files. Codex
sessions are per rollout file; forked rollouts skip their replayed prefix via
the rewritten-burst heuristic, and a fork whose transcript ends with its
first usage event still parked is released by an end-of-file flush once the
burst window has passed in wall-clock time (see `src/token_usage/codex.rs`
for the deviations from ccusage's parent-prefix matching).

## Accepted limitations

Reviewed decisions, accepted rather than accidental:

- **Corrections withheld during exclusion are not replayed.** Events filtered
  by the repo exclude gate are marked delivered like every other metric kind;
  a bucket corrected while its repo was excluded stays diverged on the server
  until the bucket's aggregate changes again after un-exclusion.
- **Uploader abandonment applies.** TokenUsage rides the shared metrics
  uploader, which abandons records after six failed upload attempts
  (~20 hours offline). The state database has already marked those buckets
  emitted, so this loses any emission — first emissions included (e.g. a
  historical backfill that ran entirely during a >20h upload outage), not
  just corrections. A later genuine change to a bucket re-emits it at a
  higher revision and heals that bucket, but a bucket that never changes
  again is lost.
- **Rewritten transcript content stays counted.** Entries have no per-file
  ownership, so history that a rewrite/truncation removed from a transcript
  keeps its rows (bounded by 90-day retention). Transcripts are append-only
  in practice; the shrink path re-reads from byte 0 and dedup absorbs the
  replay.
- **Sweep-discovered work sits outside the `git-ai await` drain barrier**
  (see Pipeline): backfill is eventual, matching stream-worker semantics.
- **A fork burst split across passes can over-count one event.** The
  end-of-file flush releases a parked first turn after the burst window
  passes in wall clock. If Codex writes the replayed burst lines more than a
  second apart (buffered/laggy serialization carrying sub-second recorded
  timestamps) and a pass lands in the gap, the parked replay is released as
  own usage. The flush leaves the skip machine armed at the released event's
  timestamp, so the late-arriving remainder of the burst is still skipped —
  the over-count is bounded to that single released event per fork, and the
  race requires write lag upstream's post-hoc whole-file reads never
  observe.
